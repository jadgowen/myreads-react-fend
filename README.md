## Getting Started

* Download or clone the [repository](https://github.com/jadgowen/myreads-react-fend.git)
* Install all project dependencies via the bash command `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`

## Using The App

The goal of the project is to allow users to arrange books into three categories: currently reading, want to read, or read. Users can also add additional books to the current list by clicking the `+` button in the bottom right of the home page, searching for books by title or author, and selecting the category they wish to add the book to. Search terms are limited, as described below...

## Search Terms

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.


## Dependencies

This project leverages css, html, and API functionality provided by Udacity from the [starter project](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter). Additional functionality leveraging those initial resources was created by me and inspired by all of the great contributors at sites like StackOverflow, MDN Developer, w3 Schools, and most impressive, the great students at Udacity!
